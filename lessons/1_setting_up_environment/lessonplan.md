# Setting Up the Environment

We will be using vagrant to standardise the environment so following the lesson
plan is easy. The Vagrantfile will provision the appropriate pre-requisites but
please go through this document to get an understanding of the steps required to
prepare the testing environment.

## Mandatory Steps

First, install vagrant and virtualbox. Vagrant can be downloaded from [this
link](vagrantdl). Virtualbox can be downloaded from [here](virtualboxdl).

Next, clone the repository onto your host machine. If you have messed up
somewhere along the course and want to revert the state of the repository, just
delete the entire directory and perform this step again.

```shell
amon@bethany:~$ git clone https://github.com/nnamon/linux-exploitation-course.git
Cloning into 'linux-exploitation-course'...
remote: Counting objects: 19, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (14/14), done.
remote: Total 19 (delta 2), reused 15 (delta 1), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (19/19), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
amon@bethany:~$
```

Now, bring the vagrant box up.

```shell
amon@bethany:~/sproink/linux-exploitation-course$ vagrant up
Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
==> default: Importing base box 'ubuntu/xenial64'...
==> default: Matching MAC address for NAT networking...
==> default: Checking if box 'ubuntu/xenial64' is up to date...
==> default: Setting the name of the VM: linux-exploitation-course_default_1483872823092_95278
==> default: Clearing any previously set network interfaces...
==> default: Preparing network interfaces based on configuration...
    default: Adapter 1: nat
==> default: Forwarding ports...
    default: 22 (guest) => 2222 (host) (adapter 1)
==> default: Running 'pre-boot' VM customizations...
==> default: Booting VM...
==> default: Waiting for machine to boot. This may take a few minutes...
    default: SSH address: 127.0.0.1:2222
    default: SSH username: ubuntu
    default: SSH auth method: password
    default:
    default: Inserting generated public key within guest...
    default: Removing insecure key from the guest if it's present...
    default: Key inserted! Disconnecting and reconnecting using new SSH key...
... snip ...
```

Once the provisioning finishes, you can ssh into the vagrant box.

```shell
amon@bethany:~/linux-exploitation-course$ vagrant ssh

```

The course repository directory you clone previously will be mounted at
`/vagrant` so you can use your preferred text editor.

## Windows Users

For Windows users there are two options:

1. Start a virtual machine containing Ubuntu 16.04 and run the provisioning
   script found below. Next, manually clone the course repository into the
   machine. Note that directory locations may be different from the code
   listings in the course if you go down this route. The choice of
   virtualisation software you choose is up to you.
2. Install Vagrant and Virtualbox for Windows. This allows you to follow the
   instructions above almost identically.

One caveat with Option 2 is that your Windows Installation might not have SSH
installed previously. When you invoke `vagrant ssh`, you might receive a message
as follows:

```shell
D:\linux-exploitation-course>vagrant ssh
`ssh` executable not found in any directories in the %PATH% variable. Is an
SSH client installed? Try installing Cygwin, MinGW or Git, all of which
contain an SSH client. Or use your favorite SSH client with the following
authentication information shown below:

Host: 127.0.0.1
Port: 2222
Username: ubuntu
Private key:
D:/linux-exploitation-course/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key
```

In that case, simply follow the instructions to SSH into the newly provisioned
system with an SSH client of your choice such as Putty.

## What Was Installed?

This is the entire provisioning script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
dpkg --add-architecture i386
apt-get update
apt-get install -y libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386 gdb python python-pip libssl-dev gcc git binutils
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pwntools
pip install ipython
pip install ropper
git clone https://github.com/longld/peda.git /home/ubuntu/peda
echo "source ~/peda/peda.py" >> /home/ubuntu/.gdbinit
```
